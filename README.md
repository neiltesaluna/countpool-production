# countpool

Exploring the ability to store timers in **local storage**. JavaScript handles the manipulation of timers stored locally and is also used to countdown the timers displayed.

This project is using the **Flask web framework** and also incorporates **Bootstrap** styling. **Frozen-Flask** is used to build the web application into a set of static files, this allows the website to be hosted using **Netlify**.
